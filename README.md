Here is the required list of libraries (for python3):
- tkinter 
- nibabel
- matplotlib
- PIL
- numpy
- networkx
- scikit-image
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- opencv (cv2)

This GUI was originally coded for Windows and Linux, but the version on this repository has been sligthly modified to better function on macOS. This may cause some incoherences when pressing buttons.

This project was done during a two-week full-time project in Télécom Paris under the supervision of Isabelle Bloch, Pietro Gori and Mateus Riva.
